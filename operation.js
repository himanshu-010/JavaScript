// what is operation
// operation simply means  to perfroms some actions like add two number and so on
// in this case we are going to perform addition operation
console.log(2 + 6)
console.log(2 * 6)
console.log(2 - 6)
console.log(2 / 6)
console.log(2 % 6)

// what is print of you write one string one one number ?
console.log("4" + 7);
// here we are going to print 47 because we are adding string and number together
// similarly 
console.log(6 + "8");
//here give me output in 68 beacuse we are adding number and string together
// so we can say that in js string is converted to number and vice versa
// but we can't convert number to boolean and vice versa


console.log(6+7+"78");
// here we are going to print 1378 because we are adding number and string together

//similarly 
console.log("7"+7+90);
// here we are going to print 7790 because we are adding string and number together

// what is prefix or postfix 
let value = 78
value++;
console.log(value);
// here we are going to print 79 because we are incrementing the value of variable by
++value;
console.log(value);
// here we are going to print 80 because we are incrementing the value of variable by
// same like increment => decrement -- 




let value2 = 90;
--value2
console.log (value2);
// here we are going to print 89 because we are decrementing the value of variable by
// same like -- => ++

// operatuion one is add two variabes easly like
let str1 ="Himanshu";
let str2 = " Kumar";
console.log(str1+str2);
// here we are output become himanshu Kumar
